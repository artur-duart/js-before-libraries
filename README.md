# JavaScript Summary 📝

This is a summary of the main topics that you should learn in JavaScript before moving on to libraries and frameworks.

## 1. Compilers and Bundlers 🛠️

Code compilers, such as Babel, are tools that transform code from one format to another, allowing you to write JavaScript code using the latest features and compile it into a version that browsers can understand. Bundling tools, such as webpack, take multiple source files from our application and convert them into a single file.

## 2. Nullish coalescing operator ?? 🔍

The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??) is a logical operator that can be used to handle null or undefined values. It is similar to the OR (||) operator, but more restrictive.

## 3. Objects 🧱

Objects in JavaScript are data structures that allow you to store sets of key-value pairs. They are useful for representing complex entities with multiple properties.

## 4. Destructuring 🎁

Destructuring is a feature of JavaScript that allows you to extract values from objects and arrays and assign them to individual variables. This can be useful when you want to work with only some properties of an object without having to access them directly.

## 5. Spread Operator and Rest Operator 🌟

The Spread Operator allows you to expand an array or object into its individual elements. It is useful when you want to copy or combine arrays or objects, or when you want to pass the elements of an array as arguments to a function. The Rest Operator, on the other hand, allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array within a function.

## 6. Short Syntax ✂️

Short syntaxes can help write optimized code.

## 7. Optional Chaining 🔗

Optional Chaining is a feature of JavaScript that allows you to access values of nested properties in objects in a simpler and safer way.

## 8. Map 🗺️

The `map` method is a powerful way to traverse and transform arrays in JavaScript. It is similar to `for` and `forEach` loops, but with some important differences.

## 9. Filter 🧹

The `filter` method is a powerful way to filter elements of an array in JavaScript. It is similar to the `map` method, but with some important differences.

## 10. Every ✅

The `every` method is a powerful way to check if all elements of an array meet a certain criterion. It returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether all elements passed the test or not.

## 11. Some 🤔

The `some` method is a powerful way to check if at least one element of an array meets a certain criterion. It returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether at least one element passed the test or not.

## 12. Find 🔍

The `find` method is a way to find an element in an array. It returns the first element that meets a certain criterion.

## 13. Find Index 🔎

The `findIndex` method is a way to find the index of an element in an array. It returns the index of the first element that meets a certain criterion.

## 14. Reduce ➖

The `reduce` method is a way to transform an array into a single value in JavaScript.

## 15. Template Literals 💬

Template Literals are a way to create strings in JavaScript. They allow you to include expressions and variables within a string in a simple and readable way.

## 16. Promises 🤞

Promises are a way to deal with asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They allow you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and easy-to-understand manner, avoiding the so-called "callback hell."

## 17. ES Modules 📦

Named exports allow you to export multiple values from a module and import only the values you need using destructuring import syntax. Default exports, on the other hand, allow you to export only one default value from a module, which can be imported using standard import syntax.
